# fcc: Pomodoro Clock

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/Dominic-Mikelis/pen/xxJvvvo](https://codepen.io/Dominic-Mikelis/pen/xxJvvvo).

Live demo shows code compiled through Codepen's export; code as I edited it can be reviewed in the codepen-src folder.

Renders a display made up of three main parts:
    A panel for modifying the length of the break/work intervals
    A panel to show current state and associated message, as well as a fun icon
    A clock/timer element showing time left in the current state (or work state if on pause)

Handles all changes through the React state, while the rendered output is styled and arranged completely through CSS.
